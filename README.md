# OSMI Forums

## Backstory

Devpressed.com was an online forum for talking about mental health in tech, but since they don't have the bandwidth to continue running them, OSMI will be taking them under our wing. :bird:

We are still sorting out the finer details of this migration, so watch this repo :point_up: for updates and volunteer opportunities.
